# Bitchat Flutter Client

This Flutter project demonstrates basic Bluetooth LE scanning using
`flutter_reactive_ble`. It will eventually replace the native Swift
implementation with a cross-platform client. The initial release targets
Android and iOS only.

## Getting Started

Run the example:

```bash
cd flutter_client
flutter run
```
