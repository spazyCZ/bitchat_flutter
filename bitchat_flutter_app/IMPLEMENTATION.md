# Flutter Implementation Progress

## What Has Been Implemented

### âœ… Core Components Completed

#### 1. Project Structure
- Complete Flutter project scaffolding with proper dependencies
- Android and iOS platform configurations with Bluetooth permissions
- Organized code structure following Flutter best practices

#### 2. Binary Protocol (Dart Port)
- **BitchatPacket**: Core message packet format compatible with Swift version
- **BinaryProtocol**: Encoder/decoder for efficient BLE communication
- **MessageType**: Enum with all message types (message, announce, private, etc.)
- Maintains full binary compatibility with original Swift implementation

#### 3. Bluetooth Mesh Service
- **BluetoothMeshService**: Foundation for BLE mesh networking using flutter_blue_plus
- Device discovery and connection management
- Message routing and forwarding logic structure
- Peer management and announcement system
- Stream-based event handling for real-time updates

#### 4. Data Models
- **BitchatMessage**: UI-friendly message representation
- Support for system messages, private messages, relayed messages
- Message metadata (timestamps, mentions, channels)
- Unique ID generation and message classification

#### 5. Chat System
- **ChatViewModel**: Main application state management
- Command system (/who, /join, /leave, /nick, /help, etc.)
- Real-time message handling and display
- Peer connection tracking
- Channel management foundation

#### 6. User Interface
- **HomeScreen**: Terminal-style chat interface matching original aesthetic
- Real-time message display with timestamps
- Command input system
- Peer connection indicator
- Channel status display
- Dark theme with green monospace font (matches original)

#### 7. Testing
- Unit tests for binary protocol encoding/decoding
- Message model tests
- Widget tests for main app component
- Example usage demonstrations

### ðŸ”„ Architecture Highlights

#### Protocol Compatibility
The Flutter implementation maintains full binary protocol compatibility with the Swift version:
- Same UUIDs for BLE service and characteristics
- Identical packet structure and encoding
- Compatible message types and flags
- Cross-platform mesh networking capability

#### Real-time Event Handling
```dart
// Stream-based architecture for real-time updates
meshService.messageStream.listen((packet) => handleMessage(packet));
meshService.peerJoinStream.listen((peerID) => handlePeerJoin(peerID));
meshService.connectionStatusStream.listen((status) => updateUI(status));
```

#### Command System
Familiar IRC-style commands implemented:
- `/who` - Show connected peers  
- `/join #channel` - Join/create channels
- `/nick <name>` - Change nickname
- `/help` - Show available commands

#### Terminal UI
Authentic terminal aesthetic:
- Monospace font throughout
- Green text on black background
- Timestamped messages with sender display
- System notifications in italics
- Connection status indicators

## Demo Walkthrough

### Message Flow Example
1. **User types message** â†’ ChatViewModel processes input
2. **Command detection** â†’ Handle `/commands` or send as regular message  
3. **Create packet** â†’ BitchatPacket with binary protocol encoding
4. **BLE transmission** â†’ BluetoothMeshService broadcasts to peers
5. **Receive & decode** â†’ Incoming packets decoded and displayed
6. **Relay handling** â†’ TTL-based forwarding through mesh network

### Binary Protocol Demo
```dart
// Create message packet
final packet = BitchatPacket.create(
  messageType: MessageType.message,
  senderIDString: 'alice123', 
  payload: 'Hello mesh!'.codeUnits,
  ttl: 3
);

// Encode to binary (ready for BLE transmission)
final encoded = BinaryProtocol.encode(packet); // Returns Uint8List

// Decode incoming binary data
final decoded = BinaryProtocol.decode(encoded); // Returns BitchatPacket
```

### UI Message Display
```
[12:34:56] <Alice> Hello everyone!
[12:35:02] * Peer connected: Bob  
[12:35:15] <Bob> Hi Alice, got your message via the mesh
[12:35:20] <Charlie (via Bob)> This message was relayed!
```

## Next Steps for Development

### High Priority
1. **Complete BLE advertising** - Platform-specific peripheral mode implementation
2. **Add encryption** - X25519 key exchange + AES-256-GCM (port from Swift)
3. **Message relay logic** - Complete TTL-based forwarding and duplicate detection
4. **Error handling** - Connection failures, packet corruption, permission denials

### Medium Priority  
1. **Channel management** - Password protection, ownership, member lists
2. **Message compression** - LZ4 compression for larger payloads
3. **Battery optimization** - Duty cycling, power mode adaptation
4. **Persistent storage** - Message history and settings

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced UI** - Rich text, file sharing, emoji support
2. **Network analytics** - Mesh topology visualization, signal strength
3. **Cross-platform testing** - iOS â†” Android â†” macOS communication
4. **Performance optimization** - Memory usage, message throughput

## Testing Requirements

Since this is a mesh networking app, proper testing requires:
- **Multiple physical devices** with Bluetooth LE capability
- **Devices within range** (typically 10-50 meters)
- **Proper permissions** granted on all platforms
- **Real-world scenarios** to test mesh relay functionality

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for building a complete Flutter version of bitchat while maintaining compatibility with the existing Swift implementation.
